2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Overall, I feel like I didn't encounter some big challenge, and I'm quite enjoyable in it. The only challenge I would say is how to implement the game logic inside guess() function. I decided not looking at answer but implement it by myself. At first, I was quite confused, because the logic here is not traditional code we implement in college study (clicking run button, and the program start running until it finish). Instead, I also need to take user's action into consideration through timestamp, and handle variables dynamically. Also, this function requires us to plugin several helper functions that we already been defined (starGame(), winGame(), etc), which I thought was a little bit abstract. Soon, I realized that we only need to consider the result of a single action (one click of a particular button from user), and outcomes of that action.
